  "note": "This is Rotten Sea or also it is called Syvash Lake. Such an unique place and absolutely incomparable to anything else. The consistency of salt is 300 grams in 1 liter of water. It feels like you walk on salt. It is very shallow and dries out in places during the summer . To be honest, this one of the places that is impossible to describe in words, you have to see it live. When you are there it just feels like you are on another planet. Must, must, must to visit!"

So it is perfect for racquet sports lovers like me! Playing with that view is a little distracting, but amusing at the same time ! Also, ocean after the games is a fantastic idea!
